# mlops-model-serving

This project is designed for serving machine learning models using a structured approach that includes model management, data handling, and API development.

## Project Structure

- **app/**: Contains the main application code.
  - `__init__.py`: Initializes the app package.
  - `main.py`: Entry point for the application, handling server startup and request management.
  - `model.py`: Contains logic for loading and serving the machine learning model.
  - `schemas.py`: Defines data validation schemas for API input and output.

- **data/**: Directory for storing data files that may be used for retraining the model in the future.

- **models/**: Directory for pre-trained model files that can be downloaded manually.

- **notebooks/**: Optional directory for Jupyter notebooks used for experimentation or model training scripts.

- **tests/**: Contains unit tests for the API.
  - `test_api.py`: Includes test cases to ensure API endpoints function as expected.

- **Dockerfile**: Instructions for building a Docker image for the application.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mlops-model-serving
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```
   python app/main.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the API endpoints defined in `main.py`. Refer to the documentation within the code for specific endpoint details and usage examples.
